## My process

### Built with


- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned how to use css properties like "display:none;" to create a dropdown. I also learned the data type for event objects in TypeScript.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

I would like to get better at styling, especially media queries and switching from mobile to desktop.
